Please find all installation instructions and documentation at https://comprior.readthedocs.io

There are currently - besides the example data sets - data sets for two case studies: Glioma (TCGA-GBM/LGG and REMBRANDT (GEO Accession Number: GSE108474)) and breast cancer (TCGA-BRCA and SCAN-B (GEO Accession Number: GSE81538)). Unpack the zipped files after you installed Comprior (or updated the Comprior Docker config file accordingly) to run the example case studies.
